## Introduction 

These data are from my dissertation chapter on ontogenetic scaling of the Oregon crab *Hemigrapsus oregonensis*. 


## Data 

We'll load the data here from the csv file:

```{r}
crabs<-read.csv("babycrab1.csv", header = TRUE, skip = 1)
crabs<-crabs[,1:13]
```

The carapace size range (in mm) is: 

```{r}
range(crabs$size..mm.)
```

## Results 

We want to check to see if various measurements scale allometrically with carapace size. So first we'll plot hair diameter against carapace width: 

```{r}
plot(crabs$log.size,log(crabs$Hair.diameter),
     xlab = "log hair diameter (m)", ylab = "log carapace width (m)",
     pch = 19, col = "blue")
```
Run a linear model on the data: 
```{r}
hairdia.model <- lm(log(crabs$Hair.diameter)~crabs$log.size)
summary(hairdia.model)
```
## Discussion

So in conclusion, hair diameter scales allometrically with body size, and the slope is 0.28. 

The end.
